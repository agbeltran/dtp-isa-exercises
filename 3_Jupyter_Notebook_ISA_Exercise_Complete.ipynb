    "# Data Management Exercise using ISA Model and ISA API \n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise, in the form of a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook [1,2], is meant to identify key elements of experimental design from an actual study narrative and build a digital archive from them. This is achieved by structuring experimental metadata following a principled approach, driven by experimental design concepts, by relying on a Python application programming interface (API), the [ISA-API](http://github.com/isa-tools/isa-api) [3,4]. This ISA-API supports the [Investigation Study Assay Metadata model](http://isa-tools.org/) [5]. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Recognize and identify the key experimental design descriptors.\n",
    "- Formalize the experimental design concepts using the ISA-API model. \n",
    "- Generate the study's metadata archive, corresponding to the experiment narrative, as an ISA format.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - Male Fisher F344 rats purchased from Charles River Laboratories were treated with either of *three chemical compounds* commonly used painkillers, namely (*aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen*), at *two distinct dose levels* (*low dose and high dose*), delivered per os. Observations were made at *three different time points* (*1 hour, 2 hours and 4 hours*).\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - Equal numbers of animals (n=5) were allocated to each of the possible study groups, defined by a unique *compound, dose level and time post exposure*  combination. Following sacrifice, performed by cervical dislocation preceded by anesthesia (ketamine and xylazine solution), *blood* and *liver* specimens (1 of each per animal) were collected.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - For liver samples, *total RNAs* was extracted; *transcription profiling* using *nucleotide sequencing* was performed *once* using a *paired-end library* approach on an *Illumina platform* using an *Illumina HiSeq 2000* as *sequencing instrument*.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - For blood samples, collected at sacrifice time and immediately placed in precooled 60 percent methanol ammonium bicarbonate buffer to extinguish cellular metabolism, *metabolites* were extracted in either *water-soluble fractions* or *lipophilic fractions*. *Metabolite profiling* using *mass spectrometry* was performed on the polar metabolite fraction only, using an *Agilent 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF* mass spectrometry instrument platform. Each fraction was introduced in the mass spectrometer by flow injection analysis (FIA) *twice* and data were acquired in both ionization modes (i.e. *positive*  and *negative*). Raw data files were saved in the native instrument format and later converted to [mzML](https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.26dmba), the HUPO-PSI standard format for mass spectrometry.\n"

    "isa_study.description = \"Male Fisher F344 rats purchased from Charles River were treated with either of three chemical compounds commonly used painkillers, namely (aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen), at two distinct dose levels (low dose and high dose), delivered per os. Observations were made at three different time points (1 hour, 2 hours and 4 hours). Equal numbers of animals (n=5) were allocated to each of the possible study groups, defined by a unique *compound, dose level and duration post exposure*  combination. Following sacrifice, performed by cervical dislocation preceded by anesthesia (ketamine and xylazine solution), blood and liver specimens (1 each per animal) were collected. For liver samples, total RNAs was extracted; transcription profiling using nucleotide sequencing was performed using paired-end libraries on an Illumina platform using an HiSeq 2000 as sequencing instrument. For blood samples, collected at sacrifice time and immediately placed in precooled 60 percent methanol ammonium bicarbonate buffer to extinguish cellular metabolism, metabolites were extracted in either water-soluble fractions or lipophilic fractions. Metabolite profiling using mass spectrometry was performed on the polar metabolite fraction only, using an Agilent 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF Mass Sprectrometry instrument platform. Each fraction was injected by flow injection analysis (FIA) twice and data were acquired in both ionization modes (i.e. positive mode and negative mode). Raw data files were saved in the native instrument format and later converted to mzML\""
